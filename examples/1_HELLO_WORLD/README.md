## Generating a Project

```bash
cmake [<options>] -S <path-to-source> -B <path-to-build>
```

Assuming that a CMakeLists.txt is in the root directory, you can generate a project like the following.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -S .. -B . # Option 1
cmake .. # Option 2
```

Assuming that you have already built the CMake project, you can update the generated project.

```bash
cd build
cmake .
```

## Generator for GCC and Clang

```bash
cd build
cmake -S .. -B . -G "Unix Makefiles" # Option 1
cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" # Option 2
```

## Generator for MSVC

```bash
cd build
cmake -S .. -B . -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" # Option 1
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" # Option 2
```
